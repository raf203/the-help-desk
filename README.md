### Usage

#### Sign Up
To create your manager account, sign up as Unit 000. This designates you as an admin and let's you manage all your renters and their tickets. 

To create your renter account, sign up as your unit number.

#### Create Ticket
Create tickets with New Ticket link. Give a title to your issue and describe the issue in the message field. Select type of issue. Designate if the issue is private. If it is private, only you and the property manager and see and respond to ticket.

#### Update Ticket Status
The ticket poster and the manager can change the project status of the ticket. All tickets default to Open status. You can change the status of a ticket from In-Progress to Closed or back to Open.

#### Removing Previous Tenants
When a renter moves out the admin can delete the user from the system. Their login will not work after deletion. Logged in as admin, go to Accounts tab and click the Delete button next to the unit that has moved out.
